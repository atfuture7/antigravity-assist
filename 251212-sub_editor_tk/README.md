# Audio srt editor v2 - tkinter

I upgraded version v1 to the tkinter version. I had Antigravity reference my HTML-formatted UI sketches. The first version looked terrible because the AI ​​couldn't utilize its HTML expertise in tkinter; my UI design was very rough. I knew that. Later, Antigravity suggested using tkinter's Grid elements, and the UI looked much better. The tkinter version is much lighter than the WebUI version.
